* Introduction

* What is Bioinformatics?

"Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological ... data, including those to ... organise... analyse or visualize such data."

* What data do we look at?

Essentially collections of related data:

Genome

- an organism's _inherited_ genetic information

Transcriptome

- the transcriptional state of an organism, tissue, cell or sample

Proteome, Metabolome, Interactome, Methylome, etc. ...

- the protein expression, metabolic, interaction, etc. ... state of a sample

Metagenome

- genomes of whole communities of organisms


* Why do we do this?

Living systems involve complex interactions between large numbers of components.

Finding patterns in biological data allows us to see how living systems function.

Using large data sets, we can find subtle associations between parts and processes:

- genotype vs. disease state, product output, pathogen virulence
- transcriptional state vs. patient response to treatment
- _etc_.

* Why do we do this?

Extending our range of data allows a richer space of phenotypes and genotypes to explore.

We can use evolutionary history to perform deeper analyses:

- comparative analysis across species
- origins of evolutionary innovations
- provide insight to design useful new traits in commercially important species and models for human disease


* Applications

* What can we do with these data?

Genome data allows us to examine:

- variation within/between species
- genome organisation and evolution, gene origin and functions
- changes resulting from disease such as cancer

Transcriptome data allows us to examine:

- gene activity in different conditions/tissues/strains/samples
- parental origin of expressed genes
- alternative splicing of mRNAs

Other-ome data allows us to examine:

- which parts of a genome talk to each other (Interactome)
- which small molecules are active/changing in a sample (Metabolome)


* Genomics

Genomics is the examination and interpretation of roles genomic sequences.

Many choices of input material and analytical approach:

- Species, strain, individual
- Sequencing technology and strategy
- _de_novo_ vs. resequencing (assembly vs. alignment)


* Genome sizes

# This slide is to raise the issue that the sizes of problems dealt
# with in genomics range widely, but also significantly, that they
# can be very large.
# The following few slides extend on this, including showing that
# the problems are not well defined (although improving) and
# providing comparisons between human and common models.

* Human Genome structure

A history of reducing estimates.

- 1969: 2,000,000 genes

- 2000 estimated: 120,000 genes

- 2001 (draft HGP): 35,000-75,000 genes

- 2004 ("finished" HGP): 20,000-25,000 genes

Current estimate: 22,000 genes


* Human Genome structure

≈ 3x10⁹ base pairs (x 2 copies)

- 1000x Bacteria, 10x Pufferfish, 0.02x Lungfish*

# Lungfish is really just crazy and probably derived.
# http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v99/n2/full/6800981a.html

≈ 1.5% exons

≈ 22,000 genes

- 4x Yeast, 1.5x Fruit fly, 0.3x _Trichomonas_vaginalis_ *

# T.vaginalis - many genes are tenuously supported, so may estimate downwards.

≈ 50% repeats

- Maize: 66%, Chicken: 10%


* Genome sequencing

* DNA Sequencing technology

DNA sequencing is cheap now:

- currently: $1 per million bases
- 10 years ago: $1 per thousand bases

Sequencing technology changes have driven this reduction.

First, Second, Third Generation sequencing:

- First: one sequence per PCR
- Second: millions of sequences per PCR
- Third: single molecule sequencing without PCR

* Introducing!

* What this means

Illumina has announced the HiSeq X, capable of 340 genomes per week at a cost of $1000 per genome.

"As a computationalist, this announcement from Illumina and the prospect of a $1000 genome is actually quite horrifying because the end of that $1000 sequencing process is only the very beginning of the computational demands associated with genome sequencing."

* What this means

History of computational effort over a two month project with similar data mass as one week's output from a HiSeq X.

# This slide is intended to show both the mass and the spikiness of
# computational resource use that is likely to result from HiSeqX adoption.

* Using the data

* Melanoma

# A brief introduction explaining the importance of this health issue.

A significant health burden on the Australian population.

# Genomics can be used to find genetic variants that predispose individuals
# to this disease - this can be used to direct preventative measures and may
# suggest approaches to treatments. For example:

* Gene expression

# Transcriptomic data in conjunction with genomic data can be used to
# determine levels of gene expression. The two data sets are complementary;
# transcriptomic data helps refine and validate genomic information, e.g.
# gene models.
#
# Note that only the alignment and alignment profile was included in the
# original lectures.

* Gene expression

# This slide just shows a real-world example of how these kinds of data
# are visualised.

.image bioinformatics/images/WT-F2-Rep1vsMut-F2_Rep1_IGV.png 500 _


* Problem size

* Big data sets

One DNA sequence run = 1 terabyte (10¹² bytes)

Efficient algorithms are needed for sequence analysis:

- assemble sequence reads _de_novo_
- align sequence reads to a reference genome

Genome analysis:

- find genes, variants, regulatory elements, evolutionary important regions

Transcriptome analysis:

- identify transcripts, determine expression levels, control for experiment bias


* Aligning reads

# Brief comment on BWS - mention that it will be discussed further in
# a later lecture.

Burrows-Wheeler search

* Viewing alignments

# This is again, just an example of how these data may be viewed - including
# the inset box which gives detailed information on a single read mapping.
# The point here is that good tools are needed to deal with the very large
# datasets we use. Human visualisation may not be the best approach!

* Common features are informative

# The following two slide take images from "Evolutionarily conserved elements
# in vertebrate, insect, worm, and yeast genomes" which is the phastCons paper.
#
# Note that in the original lecture these were split over two slides to make
# them easier to read. They are joined in the original paper, so we put them
# on one slide to avoid the need to include as an asset.
#
# "exons 7–11 of the RNA-edited human gene GRIA2 are shown. Peaks in the
# conservation plot generally correspond to exons and valleys to noncoding
# regions, but a 158-bp conserved noncoding element can be seen near the 3′
# end of exon 11. This conserved element includes the editing complementary
# sequence (ECS) of the RNA editing site in exon 11.""
#
# "the S. cerevisiae GAL1 gene and 5′-flanking region are shown. Strong
# cross-species conservation can be seen in the regulatory region upstream
# of the promoter, as well as in the protein-coding portion of the gene.
# The conserved element shown at bottom overlaps three GAL4-binding sites
# (highlighted in base-level view). A fourth GAL4-binding site also is
# reflected by a small bump in the conservation scores (left arrow), as is
# the promoter itself (right arrow)."

* Between-species comparison

# "The dot plot was generated from BLASTZ nucleotide alignments of the human
# X chromosome assembly, before our SHIMS-based refinement (y axis), and the
# single-haplotype mouse X-chromosome assembly (x axis); each dot represents
# >70% nucleotide identity within a 10-kb window centered on that position.
# Within the plot, diagonal lines indicate syntenic blocks between the two
# chromosomes; regions lacking these diagonal lines comprise species-specific
# sequences. Blue shading highlights divergent ampliconic regions, each >500
# kb in length, on the mouse X chromosome. Cen., centromere."

* Disease-causing organisms

Microbes are important in our lives

- sometimes good, sometimes bad

Viruses/Bacteria/Protozoa

- different properties and interactions with their host

Bioinformatic methods

- genomes — strain differences
- transcriptomes — pathogenesis
- metagenomes — community analysis


* Metagenomics

* Human metagenomics

Human health is significantly affected by the microbial communities that we live in symbiosis with.

Pathogens have an obvious impact, but other microbial species also affect human health.

For example, in the gut, the microbial flora perform a number of useful functions for their host:

- aiding in digestion
- synthesising vitamins
- producing enzymes not made by the host
- possibly also playing a role in preventing colonisation by pathogenic species

Metagenomics allows the study of the symbiosis and interactions of human genomes and genetic products, as a biological system.

* The American Gut

# This follows on from the previous slide - seque into this as 'This is an example
# of analyses that follow the approach just described.'

# sites, hair, nostril, and urine). Gut samples from individuals older than
# 2½ yr are colored brown and from individuals ages 0 to 2½ yr are colored
# across a dark purple (0 yr) to light purple (2½ yr) spectrum. Samples from
# one infant sampled repeatedly over the first 2½ yr of life are joined
# together with a purple line with a decreasingly dark hue with age. The
# infant samples are also shown in the inset. The most abundant bacterial
# families are superimposed on the same PCoA plot in the lower panel in purple.

* Progression of an infant gut microbial community

.html bioinformatics/code/video.html

* How is this useful?

Analysis of community structure can be used to identify human health states.

Different cultures and diets are associated with different community structures.

Similarly, different health states as associated with different communities...

and it appears that the causation is not only from the health to the community that is resident.


* Gut microbial communities in different health states

# Just point to (B), but mention that confounding effects are an issue.

# is proportional to the mean relative abundance of the taxon across all

* Antibiotics disrupt the gut flora

Adverse impact of antibiotics on gastrointestinal health:

- antimicrobial treatment disrupts the gut microbiota.
- opportunistic pathogens such as _Clostridium_difficile_ may colonise the gut mucosa
- stimulates an immune reaction, and release toxins that cause diarrhoea and inflammation.

Patients who have recurrent _C_._difficile_ infections have fewer protective microorganisms.

Reintroduction of protective species recovers the normal composition of the gut flora and most patients' symptoms resolve.

* Conclusions


DNA sequencing is getting ridiculously (dangerously) cheap

Powerful new tools are available (and necessary) for analysis

Bioinformatics is the use of those tools

- can help answer many biological questions

Biology will increasingly require (at least a bit of) mathematics and computing skills
